<p><strong>Researchers in Plague</strong> is a PvE guild made entirely of necromancer mains and enthusiasts. We only run necromancers and common support builds in our endgame PvE.</p>

<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t be an asshat. This means no toxicity, racism, elitism, etc. It’s really hard to enjoy the best class in the game when someone’s being a jerk.</li>
  <li>All endgame group content within the guild must be played on a necromancer or on a support class. See the Acceptable Builds section for more information.</li>
  <li>No rep requirements. Those are dumb.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="requirements-to-join">Requirements to Join</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Between all of your necromancers, you must have at least 250 hours played. We are looking for necro mains, not people that just play it as a flavor of the month class.</li>
  <li>You must agree that necromancer is the best class in the game. All other support classes exist for the sole purpose of buffing necros for maximum necro. Praise necro.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="acceptable-builds">Acceptable Builds</h2>

<p>This is a guild of necro mains, so it only makes sense that we stack as many necros as possible without sacrificing DPS. To enforce this, we have a list of acceptable builds that are alright to play in our endgame content.
Endgame content is defined as any dungeon, raid, or fractal. You can bring whatever you want to guild missions and open world shenanigans, but necro would be cool.</p>

<p><img src="/images/necro.png" alt="necro" /> Any non-troll necromancer build.</p>

<p><img src="/images/chrono.png" alt="chrono" /> A chronomancer primarily built to share quickness and alacrity.</p>

<p><img src="/images/druid.png" alt="druid" /> A druid build primarily focused on healing and pumping boons to boost DPS. Off healers are okay too, but I will eternally shame you for playing literally anything but heal scourge up here.</p>

<p><img src="/images/warrior.png" alt="warrior" /> A warrior build that brings both Banner of Strength and Banner of Discipline. <strong>Please run Empower Allies if you have two or more power necros.</strong></p>

<h3 id="acceptable-non-necro-dps-builds">Acceptable Non-Necro DPS Builds</h3>

<p><img src="/images/mirage.png" alt="mirage" /> If the guild is fighting Matthias, it is okay to run one mirage for reflects.</p>

<p><img src="/images/engi.png" alt="engi" /> DPS engineers may be run in tandem with condi necros to boost DPS with Pinpoint Distribution.</p>

<p>If you happen to not be playing necro at the moment, please respect this rule by only playing a build that will significantly assist a necromancer in PvE.</p>

<h2 id="raids">Raids</h2>

<p>We are currently working on forming a raid static. In order to be considered, you must meet the following non-negotiable requirements.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You have at least one kill on every raid boss, including wing 5. We are <em>not</em> a training guild.</li>
  <li>You understand all boss mechanics relevant to your role(s).</li>
  <li>You have one fully geared DPS necromancer and two different acceptable support builds.
    <ul>
      <li>You must be able to maintain a minimum of 10k target boss DPS on each encounter.</li>
      <li>Holosmith and Mirage are nice to have, but not required.</li>
      <li>Players will switch between support and necro DPS each week so we all get a chance to play the best class in the game.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You understand why stacking necromancers works well and are able to reliably epibounce.</li>
  <li>You understand that mistakes happen sometimes, and are able to take them in stride. We will not consider toxic players.</li>
</ul>

<p>Submit your kill proof by using <code class="highlighter-rouge">$kp</code> in our Discord server. You may also include logs if you wish.</p>
