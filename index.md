# We main necromancer.

**Researchers in Plague** is a PvE guild made entirely of necromancer mains and enthusiasts. We only run necromancers and common support builds in our endgame PvE.

## Rules

* Don't be an asshat. This means no toxicity, racism, elitism, etc. It's really hard to enjoy the best class in the game when someone's being a jerk.
* All endgame group content within the guild must be played on a necromancer or on a support class. See the Acceptable Builds section for more information.

## Acceptable Builds

This is a guild of necro mains, so it only makes sense that we stack as many necros as possible without sacrificing DPS. To enforce this, we have a list of acceptable builds that are alright to play in our endgame content.
Endgame content is defined as any dungeon, raid, or fractal. You can bring whatever you want to guild missions and open world shenanigans, but necro would be cool.

![vanillashroud](/images/Death_Shroud.png) Any non-troll necromancer build.
![soi](/images/Signet_of_Inspiration.png) A chronomancer primarily built to share quickness and alacrity.
![cotw](/images/Call_of_the_Wild.png) A druid build primarily focused on healing and pumping boons to boost DPS. Off healers are okay too, but I will eternally shame you for playing literally anything but heal scourge up here.
![bstr](/images/Banner_of_Discipline) A warrior build that brings both Banner of Strength and Banner of Discipline. **Please run Empower Allies if you have two or more power necros.**

###Acceptable Non-Necro DPS Builds

![mirage](/images/mirage.png) If the guild is fighting Matthias, it is okay to run one mirage for reflects.
![ppd](/images/Pinpoint_Distribution.png) DPS engineers may be run in tandem with condi necros to boost DPS with Pinpoint Distribution.
