# We main necromancer.

**Researchers in Plague** is a PvE guild made entirely of necromancer mains and enthusiasts. We only run necromancers and common support builds in our endgame PvE.

## Rules

* Don't be an asshat. This means no toxicity, racism, elitism, etc. It's really hard to enjoy the best class in the game when someone's being a jerk.
* All endgame group content within the guild must be played on a necromancer or on a support class. See the Acceptable Builds section for more information.

## Acceptable Builds

This is a guild of necro mains, so it only makes sense that we stack as many necros as possible without sacrificing DPS. To enforce this, we have a list of acceptable builds that are alright to play in our endgame content.
Endgame content is defined as any dungeon, raid, or fractal. You can bring whatever you want to guild missions and open world shenanigans, but necro would be cool. ![fear](/RIP emotes/Fear.png)
